      <h1>Important Notice</h1>

<p>
    It is with great sorrow to write to you of our father's and mother's deaths. Robert and Frances
    Henderson were tragically killed in a car accident on Saturday night, September 22, 2001.
</p>

<p>
    There are many family history files to go through and they will carry on. Our dad did so much want
    his research to carry on; he always told me that. For the family historians, please e-mail me
    for anything. I hope I can help, although it will take some time. All of dad's books are still
    available and I will continue to mail them outas he had taught me to do.
</p>

<p>
    For those who already know, thank you for your love and support already shown. Please continue
    to pray for Karen, David, Sarah, Krista, Bobby, Myra, Brady, Myself (Gayle), Scott, Jena and Kaycee.
</p>

    Any future inquiries for Henderson books should be submitted to:

    Love,<br>
    Gayle Henderson Hannon
