        <h1>Robert H. Henderson, Sr.</h1>

        <p>Robert “Bob” Henderson collected ancestral information on our Henderson family for over 40 years. In the mid 1960’s he formed a group known as the Henderson Family Association. Bob and his wife, Frances Bishop Henderson, lived in Greer, South Carolina for over 30 years. Tragically, they both passed away on September 22, 2001 due to a car accident. They had three children, Karen Henderson Swofford, Gayle Henderson Hannon, and Bobby Henderson (Jr.), and at the time had five grandchildren, and since one has been added.</p>

        <p>Bob graduated from Furman University in 1959. He received his MBA degree from Georgia College at Milledgeville, which is a part of the University of Georgia system. He retired as a professor of business management for Limestone College in Gaffney, South Carolina. He was also one of the founders of a local bank in Greer, South Carolina, Greer State Bank, and served on its board of directors. Prior to that he was active for 30 years in private business. He was President of Alexander’s Wholesale Distributors, Inc, a five-store catalog showroom chain based in Greenville, S.C.</p>

        <p>According to his past article, for the past 208 years, his Henderson ancestors have lived within 60 miles of Greer, S. C. Currently, his daughter Gayle maintains and sends out his “treasures” of books.</p>

        <h1>Important Notice</h1>

        <p>
            It is with great sorrow to write to you of our father's and mother's deaths. Robert and Frances
            Henderson were tragically killed in a car accident on Saturday night, September 22, 2001.
        </p>

        <p>
            There are many family history files to go through and they will carry on. Our dad did so much want
            his research to carry on; he always told me that. For the family historians, please e-mail me
            for anything. I hope I can help, although it will take some time. All of dad's books are still
            available and I will continue to mail them outas he had taught me to do.
        </p>

        <p>
            For those who already know, thank you for your love and support already shown. Please continue
            to pray for Karen, David, Sarah, Krista, Bobby, Myra, Brady, Myself (Gayle), Scott, Jena and Kaycee.
        </p>
