Frances Lucille HENDERSON</b></p>
<blockquote><p>Inb Memoriam - Little Frances Lucille, daughter of W B and Mrs Sue M Henderson<br>died at her uncles, James Bowlin, in South Carolina last Friday night.  She<br>dieed very suddenly of abscess of the brain. She was three years old last<br>November, a very bright, sweet little daughter.  Her mother wnet over there to<br>see her sick brothe, and carried her little daughter, never to return again to<br>their beautiful home at Quebec.  The mother broutht her little body home<br>Saturday night in a private conveyance, and she was buried Sunday evening in<br>Oak Grove Cemetery by the side of her little brother.<p>The funeral services were conducted by the writer, their pastor.  She leaves an<br>affectionate father and mother and one little brother to mourn their<br>irreparable loss.  May this thought ever cheer and comfort their hearts; that<br>their sweet little rosebud has been transplanted from this unpropitious soil of<br>earth to the Paradise of God, where she will ever bloom in that bright world<br>where sin and death never enter.  F M Jordan, March 12th 1907. (From Sylvan<br>book Vol 1 p 37) in RHH files.</blockquote>
