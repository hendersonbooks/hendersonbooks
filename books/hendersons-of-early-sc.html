        <h1>Hendersons of Early SC – Part 3 (1950-1870) by Robert H. Henderson, Sr.</h1>
        <p>This book is designed for the Henderson researcher with roots in SC. If you had Henderson ancestors living in SC
            during this period, they are probably included in the book.</p><p>Over 1500 Henderson are presented from the three
        decades of census records with ages converted to DOB. Comparison between the various census is very helpful in
        understanding the people involved and in deciphering names. A majority of those listed are further identified by Bob
        and his advisory panel of Henderson researchers.</p><p>The census records are also sorted by name to improve
        understanding of the records. This book would not have been possible without the technical benefit of the
        computer.</p><p>At the end of the book is a collection of short biographies on many of the Hendersons listed in the
        main body of the book. Hopefully additional biographies will be encouraged by this series.</p><p>Bob also does an
        analysis of where the Hendersons were living during the time of the book. Amazingly about ¾ of all the Hendersons
        living in South Carolina are concentrated in 5 upstate counties.</p><p>Since the Civil War came during the middle
        of this study, many interesting insights into family connections become apparent. A separate schedule is also
        presented which includes references to all the known Hendersons (and their units) that serviced in the CW.</p><p>
        This book is indexed and attractively bound with a soft cover.</p>
