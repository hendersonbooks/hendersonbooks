        <h1>Robert H. Henderson, Sr.</h1>

        <p>Robert “Bob” Henderson collected ancestral information on our Henderson family for over 40 years. In the mid 1960’s he formed a group known as the Henderson Family Association. Bob and his wife, Frances Bishop Henderson, lived in Greer, South Carolina for over 30 years. Tragically, they both passed away on September 22, 2001 due to a car accident. They had three children, Karen Henderson Swofford, Gayle Henderson Hannon, and Bobby Henderson (Jr.), and at the time had six grandchildren, and since one has been added.</p>

        <p>Bob graduated from Furman University in 1959. He received his MBA degree from Georgia College at Milledgeville, which is a part of the University of Georgia system. He retired as a professor of business management for Limestone College in Gaffney, South Carolina. He was also one of the founders of a local bank in Greer, South Carolina, Greer State Bank, and served on its board of directors. Prior to that he was active for 30 years in private business. He was President of Alexander’s Wholesale Distributors, Inc, a five-store catalog showroom chain based in Greenville, S.C.</p>

        <p>According to his past article, for the past 208 years, his Henderson ancestors have lived within 60 miles of Greer, S. C. Currently, his daughter Gayle maintains and sends out his “treasures” of books.</p>
