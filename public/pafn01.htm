<p>This Thomas has to be one of 3 Thomases that we know about below:<br>1.  Thomas that d. in Louisa Co Va. in 1768<br>2.  Thomas that d. in Union Co SC in 1794<br>3.  My Thomas that d. in Laurens SC in 1806</p>
<p>I realize that Thomas of Union is generally accepted as the son of Thomas d.<br>1768 of Louisa.  However, something is wrong!</p>
<p>Also, after eliminating one of the above candidates, the parents of one of<br>the other two is likely William & Mary Henderson of Louisa Co VA (see deed<br>books E & F 11 Feb 1788).</p>
<p>all of these families have similar  names, George, Sims, Anderson, Hendrick,</p>
