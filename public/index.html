<h1>Welcome to hendersonbooks.com!</h1>
<hr>
<p>Thanks for visiting <strong>hendersonbooks.com</strong>, a terrific source of genealogical information about the descendants of Thomas HENDERSON Jr.

<p>We recently acquired this domain name and plan to move all of Bob's genealogical database information to this site ASAP.</p>

<p>The original site can still be found with one of the following two addresses:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://hendersonbooks.home.mindspring.com" target="_new">http://hendersonbooks.home.mindspring.com</a></li>
<li><a href="http://home.mindspring.com/~hendersonbooks" target="_new">http://home.mindspring.com/~hendersonbooks</a></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>The information on the old location(s) will be available there for several months. After that, there will always (hopefully) be at least a link on that site to this site, so that folks will always be able to find it.</p>

<p>As always, you can contact us in the following ways:</br></br>

It is with great sorrow to write to you of our father's and mother's deaths. Robert and Frances
Henderson were tragically killed in a car accident on Saturday night, September 22, 2001.
<br><br>
There are many family history files to go through and they will carry on. Our dad did so much want
his research to carry on;&nbsp; he always told me that. For the family historians, please e-mail me
for anything.&nbsp; I hope I can help, although it will take some time. All of dad's books are still
available and I will continue to mail them outas he had taught me to do.
<br><br>
For those who already know, thank you for your love and support already shown.&nbsp; Please continue
to pray for Karen, David, Sarah, Krista, Bobby, Myra, Brady, Myself (Gayle), Scott, Jena and Kaycee.
<br><br>
Any future inquiries for Henderson books should be submitted to:<a href="mailto:sghannon@yahoo.com">sghannon@yahoo.com</a>

Love,<br>
Gayle Henderson Hannon</span><br>
